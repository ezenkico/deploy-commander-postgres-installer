# Deploy Commander Runner — AI Implementation Guide

## Purpose

This document instructs an AI coding agent how to implement a Deploy Commander manager that uses the standard Deploy Commander runner.

The runner receives a JSON configuration containing the desired services, volumes, resources, connections, removals, and redirect state. It then translates that configuration into platform operations.

The current runner implementation supports Docker.

This guide is for implementing the manager-side planning code that produces runner configuration. It is not a guide for modifying the runner itself.

## Primary Goal

Your implementation should convert the manager’s configuration, user input, and current state into a valid runner configuration.

The resulting configuration must tell the runner:

- Which services should exist
- Which one-time runner steps should execute
- Which volumes should exist
- Which services or volumes should be removed
- Which resources services provide
- Which resource connections services consume
- Which Deploy Commander connections should be created or removed
- Whether the manager redirect should be set, changed, or cleared

The manager defines intent.

The runner performs the platform-specific execution.

## Manager and Runner Responsibility Split

In this guide, the **manager** is the manager-side planner that produces the deployment metadata. The **runner** is the process that receives that metadata and applies it to Docker.

The boundary is deliberate: the manager must provide a complete, explicit execution plan, while the runner handles the Docker and agent operations needed to apply that plan. Manager code should not create Docker objects or reproduce runner naming formulas.

| Concern                             | The manager must provide                                                                                                                       | The runner handles for the manager                                                                                                               |

| Produced resources                  | Stable resource type and name, resource metadata, and any valid public connection                                                              | Creating the resource network, attaching the producer, generating Docker platform-connection data, and publishing the resource through the agent |

| Removals                            | Exact obsolete service and volume logical names; omission is not removal                                                                       | Resolving manager-scoped Docker objects, removing only the requested objects, and cleaning up resources recorded on removed services             |

| Full teardown                       | The `teardown` action for the target manager                                                                                                   | Discovering objects by manager ownership labels and removing containers, volumes, and networks in safe order                                     |

The runner does not query manager or commander state to decide what should be deployed. It also does not derive application credentials, translate address-based connections into environment variables, infer removals from omitted entries, or validate that a supplied external Docker network semantically belongs to a particular resource. Those planning and resolution decisions remain manager responsibilities.

## Required Reading

Before implementing a manager with this runner, read:

- The project’s top-level `AGENTS.md`
- The manager project’s own `AGENTS.md`
- Any manager interface or RPC documentation used to obtain resources and connections
- The manager’s input and configuration models

This guide is intended to be sufficient when the runner source is not available to the implementing AI agent. The Go models and JSON examples below are the public manager-to-runner contract.

If shared runner models are available as a dependency, use them instead of creating duplicate types. Otherwise, reproduce only the contract required by the manager and preserve the JSON names, optionality, and nil semantics documented here.

Do not guess fields that are not documented in this guide. In particular, do not assume that a field accepted by Docker, a container image, or another deployment system is also accepted by this runner.

## Contract Boundary and Source Availability

An AI agent implementing a manager may rely on this guide without access to the runner checkout. It may:

- Generate the documented runner configuration and metadata
- Validate manager input before producing metadata
- Use the documented Docker platform-connection payload
- Test the manager’s serialization and planning behavior

It may not use this guide alone to add or change runner capabilities. A new metadata field is a versioned contract change that requires the runner source, including its shared model, platform translation, validation, cleanup behavior, tests, and documentation.

When a requested manager feature needs a field not documented here:

1. Do not emit the speculative field.
2. State that the installed runner contract does not support the feature.
3. Request the runner checkout or a runner version that explicitly implements the field.
4. If another repository owns related state, such as manager run-status values, request that repository or its authoritative API contract as well.

The runner implementation currently stores the service contract in `models/metadata_services.go` and translates services into Docker containers in `services/docker/setup.go`. These paths are provided only to help a maintainer locate the implementation after obtaining the runner source; their contents are fully summarized by this guide for ordinary manager work.

## Runner Input

The runner reads its configuration from:

```text
/run/config.json
```

The top-level configuration has this shape:

```json
{
  "manager": "manager-uuid",
  "run": "run-uuid",
  "runner": "runner-name",
  "platform": "docker",
  "platform_data": {},
  "action": "setup",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

The corresponding Go model is:

```go
type Configuration struct {
	Manager      uuid.UUID        `json:"manager"`
	Run          uuid.UUID        `json:"run"`
	Runner       string           `json:"runner"`
	Platform     string           `json:"platform"`
	PlatformData *json.RawMessage `json:"platform_data,omitempty"`
	Action       string           `json:"action"`
	Metadata     *Metadata        `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
}
```

The manager implementation may only be responsible for generating `metadata`, depending on how Deploy Commander launches and wraps the runner.

Follow the surrounding manager framework rather than duplicating fields already supplied by Deploy Commander.

Before populating the top-level fields, determine which component owns them. Commonly, the surrounding Deploy Commander framework supplies execution-envelope fields such as `manager`, `run`, `runner`, `platform`, and `action`, while manager planning code supplies `metadata`. The manager must not replace authoritative framework values with locally generated identifiers.

## Supported Platform

The current supported platform value is:

```text
docker
```

Do not emit another platform unless that platform has been implemented and registered in the runner.

`platform_data` is available for platform-specific configuration but is not currently used by the Docker implementation.

## Actions

The current Docker runner recognizes:

```text
teardown
```

A `teardown` action removes the manager’s labeled:

- Containers
- Volumes
- Networks

All other action values currently use the normal setup and reconciliation flow.

Use the action name expected by the Deploy Commander manager framework.

Do not invent action-specific behavior that the runner does not implement.

## Metadata Structure

Runner metadata has this shape:

```go
type Metadata struct {
	Services       map[string]MetadataService `json:"services,omitempty"`
	RemoveServices *[]string                  `json:"remove_services,omitempty"`
	Volumes        *[]string                  `json:"volumes,omitempty"`
	RemoveVolumes  *[]string                  `json:"remove_volumes,omitempty"`
	Connections    *ConnectionPlan            `json:"connections,omitempty"`
	Redirect       *Redirect                  `json:"redirect,omitempty"`
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "network_groups": ["frontend"],
      "environment": {
        "PORT": "8080"
      },
      "bindings": [
        {
          "container_port": 8080,
          "host_port": 8080
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "volumes": ["app-data"],
  "remove_services": ["old-worker"],
  "remove_volumes": ["old-data"]
}
```

Only include operations the current run should perform.

Do not emit empty removal entries or invalid placeholder values.

## Nil, Empty, and Omitted Values

Optional fields use pointers deliberately.

The following states may have different meanings:

- Field omitted or pointer is nil
- Field present with an empty array
- Field present with a non-empty array
- Nested field present with a nil value

Do not convert every nil field into an empty collection automatically.

For ordinary setup metadata, omit sections that do not require an operation.

Example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest"
    }
  }
}
```

This is preferable to filling every optional field with empty arrays and objects.

## Services

Services are defined as a map:

```go
map[string]MetadataService
```

Example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "image": "postgres:18"
    },
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "depends_on": ["database"]
    }
  }
}
```

The map key is the service identity.

It is used for:

- Dependency references
- Docker container naming
- Docker labels
- Removal requests
- Service ordering

Choose service keys that are:

- Stable
- Unique within the manager
- Human-readable
- Safe to use as part of a Docker object name

Do not use dynamically generated service keys unless the manager truly creates dynamic service instances.

Changing a service key causes the runner to treat it as a different service.

## Service Definition

A service supports:

```go
type MetadataService struct {
	Image         string                `json:"image"`
	Command       *[]string             `json:"command,omitempty"`
	Aliases       *[]string             `json:"aliases,omitempty"`
	NetworkGroups *[]string             `json:"network_groups,omitempty"`
	Role          *ServiceRole          `json:"role,omitempty"`
	DependsOn     *[]string             `json:"depends_on,omitempty"`
	Bindings      *[]BindingSpec        `json:"bindings,omitempty"`
	Connections   *[]ResourceConnection `json:"connections,omitempty"`
	Resources     *[]CreateResourceSpec `json:"resources,omitempty"`
	Environment   map[string]string     `json:"environment,omitempty"`
	Volumes       *[]VolumeMount        `json:"volumes,omitempty"`
	Scale         *ScaleSpec            `json:"scale,omitempty"`
}
```

A minimal service requires an image:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest"
    }
  }
}
```

Do not emit a service with an empty image.

### Commands

`command` is an optional array of strings mapped to Docker `Config.Cmd`.

```json
{
  "image": "example/app:latest",
  "command": ["serve", "--port", "8080"]
}
```

Its semantics are:

- Omitted or `null`: preserve the image’s default command.
- Non-empty array: replace Docker `Cmd` with the supplied argument vector.
- Empty array: invalid for Docker metadata validation; do not emit it.

This field changes only `Cmd`; it does not change the image entrypoint. Each array element is passed as one argument, with no shell parsing or string splitting by the runner. Use a runner-role service when the command is one-time work; normal services retain their usual restart behavior.

## Long-Running Services

The default service role is a long-running service.

It may be explicitly represented as:

```json
{
  "role": "service"
}
```

A normal service container:

- Is started by Docker
- Uses an always-restart policy
- Remains running after the runner exits
- May expose ports
- May mount volumes
- May provide resources
- May consume resource connections

The role may be omitted for normal services.

## Runner Services

Use the `runner` role for one-time setup, migration, initialization, or command execution containers.

Example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "migrate": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "role": "runner",
      "environment": {
        "COMMAND": "migrate"
      }
    },
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "depends_on": ["migrate"]
    }
  }
}
```

A runner-role container:

- Uses no restart policy
- Starts once
- Streams stdout and stderr
- Blocks dependent services until it completes
- Is removed after completion
- Fails the run when it exits with a nonzero status

Do not use a runner role for a process that must remain active.

Do not create dependency cycles between runner and service containers.

## Execution Success and Run Status

The runner has no public manager run-status enum in this contract.

Runner execution succeeds when all requested platform operations return successfully. For a `runner`-role container, exit code `0` is success; every nonzero exit code is returned as an execution error. For the top-level runner process, successful platform execution returns normally and any returned error causes the process to fail.

Do not translate these outcomes into guessed manager status strings or numbers. The manager or commander framework owns its run-status type and the terminal value that means success. Use the constants and completion API provided by that framework. If those definitions are unavailable, request the authoritative manager/commander contract before implementing status updates.

This distinction is important:

- Container exit status belongs to the executed workload.
- Runner process success or failure belongs to platform execution.
- Manager run status belongs to the manager or commander framework.

## Dependencies

Dependencies reference service map keys:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "image": "postgres:18"
    },
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "depends_on": ["database"]
    }
  }
}
```

Every dependency must exist in the same `services` map for that run.

The runner rejects:

- Missing dependency keys
- Circular dependency graphs

Dependencies control setup ordering only.

They do not perform application-level health checks.

A container being started does not necessarily mean the application inside it is ready to accept traffic.

Use an explicit runner step or application retry behavior when startup readiness matters.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are supplied as a string map:

```json
{
  "environment": {
    "PORT": "8080",
    "DATABASE_HOST": "database",
    "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
  }
}
```

Every value must be represented as a string.

Do not place secrets into logs.

Do not include environment variables unrelated to the service.

Prefer stable service aliases or connection data over hard-coded container IP addresses.

## Network Groups

Network groups allow selected services to share an isolated Docker network.

Example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "proxy": {
      "image": "example/proxy:latest",
      "network_groups": ["frontend"]
    },
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "network_groups": ["frontend", "backend"]
    },
    "database": {
      "image": "postgres:18",
      "network_groups": ["backend"]
    }
  }
}
```

The Docker runner scopes network group names to the manager.

Use a network group when multiple services within the same manager need direct communication.

Do not use network groups to reference a resource owned by another manager. Use a resource platform connection for that case.

## Default Network

When a service has no:

- Network groups
- Platform resource connection networks
- Produced resource networks

the Docker runner attaches it to a manager-level default network.

Do not depend on the exact Docker name of this default network from manager implementation code.

Use aliases and service configuration rather than reconstructing runner-generated object names.

## Aliases

Aliases are Docker network aliases applied to each network joined by the service.

Example:

```json
{
  "aliases": ["api", "internal-api"]
}
```

Use aliases when another service needs a stable hostname that differs from the service key.

Avoid duplicate aliases that would create ambiguous DNS resolution on the same Docker network.

## Volumes

Top-level volumes declare manager-owned persistent volumes:

```json
{
  "volumes": ["database-data", "uploads"]
}
```

A service mounts a declared volume using:

```json
{
  "volumes": [
    {
      "name": "database-data",
      "mount_path": "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
    }
  ]
}
```

Mount paths must:

- Be non-empty
- Be absolute
- Be unique within the service

Volume names must:

- Be non-empty
- Be unique in `metadata.volumes`

A named volume that is not declared in the current metadata must already exist for that manager.

Do not rely on undeclared volume creation.

Declare new volumes explicitly.

## Runner-Provided Volume

A volume mount with a null name requests the runner-provided manager volume:

```json
{
  "volumes": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "mount_path": "/runner"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use this only when the manager framework or runner contract expects shared runner-provided data at that mount.

Do not use an omitted `name` accidentally. In Go, this is represented with a nil pointer.

## Removing Volumes

Volumes are removed using logical names:

```json
{
  "remove_volumes": ["old-data"]
}
```

Do not include a volume in both `volumes` and `remove_volumes` in the same plan.

Do not remove a volume still required by a service that remains deployed.

Volume deletion is destructive.

The manager implementation must decide removals deliberately.

## Bindings

Bindings define container ports and optional host publication.

Example:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "container_port": 8080,
      "host_port": 8080,
      "host_ip": "0.0.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported fields are:

```go
type BindingSpec struct {
	ContainerPort *int
	HostPort      *int
	HostIP        *string
	ContainerIP   *string
}
```

The current Docker runner applies:

- `container_port`
- `host_port`
- `host_ip`

`container_ip` is not currently implemented.

The Docker implementation currently exposes each binding for both TCP and UDP.

Do not depend on protocol-specific binding behavior until the model and runner support protocol selection explicitly.

Use a valid numeric IP address for `host_ip`.

Do not use a hostname for `host_ip`.

## Produced Resources

A long-running service may publish one or more Deploy Commander resources.

Example:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "image": "postgres:18",
      "resources": [
        {
          "resource_type": "postgres",
          "name": "primary-database",
          "metadata": {
            "database": "app"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The resource specification contains:

```go
type CreateResourceSpec struct {
	ResourceType     string
	Name             string
	PublicConnection *PublicConnection
	Metadata         json.RawMessage
}
```

### What the manager must provide

The manager must place the resource specification on the producing service and provide:

- A stable, non-empty resource type
- A stable, non-empty resource name
- Resource metadata needed by authorized consumers
- A public connection only when the resource is externally reachable

The manager should also give the producing service any Docker alias that consumers are expected to use as a hostname. The runner applies declared aliases, but it does not invent a resource hostname.

Do not add Docker platform-connection data to `CreateResourceSpec`. The manager declares the resource; it does not calculate or create the resource's Docker network.

### What the runner handles

For a normal Docker service, the runner:

1. Creates a dedicated Docker resource network.
2. Attaches the producing service to the network.
3. Generates Docker platform connection data containing the exact network name.
4. Publishes the resource and generated platform connection through the agent.

Use stable resource names.

Resource names are used during cleanup.

Do not publish two different logical resources with the same name unless the surrounding agent contract explicitly supports it.

## Resource Metadata

Resource metadata is arbitrary JSON.

Example:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "engine": "postgres",
    "version": "18",
    "database": "app"
  }
}
```

Metadata should contain the information a consuming manager needs to understand or configure use of the resource.

Do not include sensitive credentials unless the resource contract specifically requires them and Deploy Commander provides secure handling.

Platform connection data is added by the runner and should not be manually placed in resource metadata.

## Public Connections

A produced resource may advertise a public address and port:

```json
{
  "public_connection": {
    "address": "database.example.com",
    "port": 5432
  }
}
```

Both fields are optional.

Only provide a public connection when the resource is actually reachable at that address.

Do not use a container-local address as a public connection.

## Consuming Resource Connections

Services consume resolved resources through `connections`.

A Docker platform connection has this exact serialized structure:

```json
{
  "type": "Platform",
  "data": {
    "network": "existing-docker-network-name"
  }
}
```

Example service:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:latest",
      "connections": [
        {
          "type": "Platform",
          "data": {
            "network": "resource-network-name"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### What the manager must provide

The manager must:

1. Obtain a resource connection the manager is authorized to consume from the authoritative manager or commander interface, or from framework-supplied state.
2. Select the resolved connection appropriate for the active platform.
3. Place the complete `ResourceConnection`, including its exact type and data, in the consuming service's `connections` array.
4. Translate resource metadata, public connection data, credentials, or address-based connection data into the consuming application's configuration when its resource contract requires that translation.

For a Docker `Platform` connection, the `data` object must contain a non-empty string field named `network`. Use the network name exactly as returned by the resolved resource connection.

The manager must not provide a resource name, service name, manager ID, container name, or URL in place of the Docker network name. It must not prefix the value with the consuming manager ID, reconstruct it from a resource name, create the network itself, or substitute a network-group name.

### What the runner handles

For each Docker `Platform` connection on a service, the runner:

1. Decodes the platform connection data.
2. Verifies that the named Docker network exists.
3. Includes that exact network in the container's Docker endpoint configuration.
4. Attaches the service when it creates the container.

The runner execution for the resource-producing manager creates and owns the resource network. The producing manager supplies the resource declaration; the consuming manager supplies the resolved connection returned for that resource. Neither manager implementation should create the Docker network directly.

The runner verifies only that the supplied network exists. It trusts the resolved platform data and does not independently prove that the network belongs to the intended resource, so the manager must obtain the connection from an authoritative, authorized source.

## Network Connections

The shared model also defines a network connection:

```json
{
  "type": "Network",
  "data": {
    "address": "service.example.com",
    "port": 443
  }
}
```

The current Docker setup logic specifically uses platform connections for Docker network attachment.

Network connection data may still be useful to manager application configuration, such as generating environment variables.

Do not assume the Docker runner automatically converts network connections into service environment variables.

The manager implementation must translate usable connection details into the service’s configuration.

The runner currently skips a `Network` connection when assembling Docker network endpoints. Supplying only an address-based `Network` connection will not attach the container to a Docker network.

## Creating Deploy Commander Connections

Connection creation plans are separate from service connection attachment.

This distinction is critical:

- `services.<service>.connections` tells the runner which already-resolved platform networks the service must join during container creation.
- Top-level `metadata.connections.create` tells the runner to create a Deploy Commander connection record through the agent.

The runner applies service setup before the top-level connection plan. Creating a connection record in the same runner configuration does not resolve it into a service connection or retroactively attach an already-created container. The manager must supply the resolved connection separately in the consuming service's `connections` array when attachment is required in that run.

Example:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "create": [
      {
        "manager": "consumer-manager-uuid",
        "resource": {
          "id": "resource-uuid"
        },
        "metadata": {
          "purpose": "primary database"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

A create specification contains:

- The manager receiving the connection
- A resource reference
- Arbitrary connection metadata

The current runner requires the resource reference to contain an existing resource UUID:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "id": "resource-uuid"
  }
}
```

Although the model supports service and name references, the current runner cannot resolve:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "service": "database",
    "name": "primary-database"
  }
}
```

Do not emit service/name references until runner-side resolution is implemented.

## Removing Deploy Commander Connections

A connection removal currently requires both:

- The connection UUID
- The related resource UUID

Example:

```json
{
  "connections": {
    "remove": [
      {
        "id": "connection-uuid",
        "resource": {
          "id": "resource-uuid"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Resource-only removal is not currently supported.

Do not emit:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "id": "resource-uuid"
  }
}
```

without a connection ID and expect all resource connections to be removed.

## Redirects

Redirect metadata controls the manager redirect stored by the Deploy Commander agent.

Set a redirect:

```json
{
  "redirect": {
    "redirect": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

Clear the redirect:

```json
{
  "redirect": {
    "redirect": null
  }
}
```

Do not update the redirect:

```json
{}
```

or omit `redirect` from the metadata.

These states are intentionally different.

Do not emit an empty redirect object unless the intention is to clear the redirect.

## Removing Services

Services are removed by service key:

```json
{
  "remove_services": ["old-worker"]
}
```

The Docker runner resolves this to the manager-scoped container name.

When removing a service, the runner also inspects its labels and attempts to delete resources previously published by that service.

Use the exact stable service key originally used to create the service.

Do not use:

- Container IDs
- Image names
- Resource names
- Network aliases

in `remove_services`.

Do not include the same service in both `services` and `remove_services` in one plan.

## Full Teardown

A teardown configuration uses:

```json
{
  "action": "teardown"
}
```

The Docker runner removes manager-owned resources in this order:

1. Services
2. Volumes
3. Networks

Teardown is based on Docker ownership labels associated with the manager UUID.

Do not attempt to reproduce full teardown using large `remove_services` and `remove_volumes` lists.

Use the teardown action when the entire manager deployment should be removed.

## Scale Specification

The shared model contains:

```go
type ScaleSpec struct {
	Mode string
	Min  *int
	Max  *int
}
```

Known scale modes include:

```text
single
autoscale
autoscale-core
global
```

The current Docker runner does not implement scaling behavior.

Do not rely on `scale` changing the number of Docker containers.

You may preserve scale intent in generated metadata for compatibility, but do not claim that it is currently enforced.

## Reconciliation Model

The runner does not perform a full declarative comparison against every existing Docker object.

It performs the operations explicitly represented by metadata:

- Services in `services` are created or replaced.
- Volumes in `volumes` are created if missing.
- Services in `remove_services` are removed.
- Volumes in `remove_volumes` are removed.
- Connection plans are applied.
- Redirect changes are applied.

The manager implementation is responsible for generating the correct operation plan.

Do not assume that omitting an old service automatically removes it.

Explicitly include it in `remove_services`.

Do not assume that omitting an old volume automatically removes it.

Explicitly include it in `remove_volumes`.

## Update Strategy

When updating an existing manager deployment:

1. Determine the desired service definitions.
2. Determine which existing service keys are no longer desired.
3. Include desired or changed services in `services`.
4. Include obsolete services in `remove_services`.
5. Include new required volumes in `volumes`.
6. Include intentionally deleted volumes in `remove_volumes`.
7. Resolve required resource connections.
8. Build connection create or remove plans.
9. Set redirect metadata only when a redirect operation is required.

Do not remove persistent data merely because a service was removed.

Treat volume removal as a separate destructive decision.

## Idempotency Expectations

Generated metadata should be safe to apply more than once where practical.

Prefer:

- Stable service keys
- Stable resource names
- Stable volume names
- Stable network group names
- Deterministic configuration
- Explicit removals

Avoid:

- Random service names
- Random resource names
- Recreating connection plans without checking current connections
- Deleting and recreating persistent volumes during ordinary updates
- Using timestamps as identities

The runner replaces a service container when that service appears in the current setup plan.

Your manager should avoid including unrelated unchanged services when unnecessary, unless the manager intentionally performs full service reconciliation.

## Current-State Queries

Before generating removal or connection operations, use the Deploy Commander manager interface or RPC calls to inspect current state where needed.

Relevant queries may include:

- Existing manager resources
- Existing connections
- Connections for a specific manager
- Connections for a specific resource
- Existing redirect state
- Prior manager configuration
- Current deployment metadata

Use the actual available RPC contract.

Do not invent RPC calls.

Do not infer connection ownership from names alone.

## Resource and Connection Ownership

A manager must only access connection data that it is authorized to retrieve.

Connection access should be limited to connections where:

- The connection is owned by the calling manager, or
- The associated resource is owned by the calling manager

Follow the Deploy Commander interface and RPC authorization model.

Do not attempt to bypass ownership by requesting raw object-store configuration or internal commander data.

## Error Handling in Manager Code

Manager implementation code should return errors through the manager framework.

Do not:

- Panic for configuration errors
- Call `os.Exit`
- Call `log.Fatal`
- Ignore failed RPC calls
- Continue after required resource resolution fails
- Emit partially valid runner metadata as though generation succeeded

Errors should identify:

- The input or configuration field
- The service or resource involved
- The failed operation
- The underlying error where useful

Use `%w` in Go when preserving the original error.

## Validation Before Returning Metadata

Validate generated metadata before returning it.

At minimum, check:

- Required images are non-empty
- Service keys are non-empty
- Dependencies reference included services
- No dependency cycles exist
- Volume names are non-empty
- Mount paths are absolute
- Mount paths are unique within each service
- Resource names are non-empty
- Resource types are non-empty
- Port values are valid
- Host IP values are valid IP addresses
- Platform connections contain required platform data
- Removal entries are non-empty
- A service is not both created and removed
- A volume is not both created and removed
- Connection removals contain the required IDs

Do not rely exclusively on the runner to reject easily detectable manager-generation mistakes.

## JSON Encoding

Use proper JSON serialization.

Do not manually assemble JSON strings.

In Go, use:

```go
json.Marshal(...)
```

Use `json.RawMessage` for arbitrary JSON fields such as:

- Resource metadata
- Connection metadata
- Platform connection data
- Platform data

Ensure every `json.RawMessage` contains valid JSON.

For an empty JSON object, use:

```go
json.RawMessage(`{}`)
```

Do not use an empty byte slice as valid metadata.

## Example: Basic Application

```json
{
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:1.0.0",
      "environment": {
        "PORT": "8080"
      },
      "bindings": [
        {
          "container_port": 8080,
          "host_port": 8080,
          "host_ip": "0.0.0.0"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Application with Persistent Data

```json
{
  "volumes": ["app-data"],
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:1.0.0",
      "volumes": [
        {
          "name": "app-data",
          "mount_path": "/var/lib/app"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Migration Followed by Application Startup

```json
{
  "services": {
    "migrate": {
      "image": "example/app:1.0.0",
      "role": "runner",
      "environment": {
        "APP_COMMAND": "migrate"
      }
    },
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:1.0.0",
      "depends_on": ["migrate"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Internal Service Networks

```json
{
  "services": {
    "proxy": {
      "image": "example/proxy:1.0.0",
      "network_groups": ["frontend"],
      "bindings": [
        {
          "container_port": 80,
          "host_port": 80
        }
      ]
    },
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:1.0.0",
      "network_groups": ["frontend", "backend"],
      "aliases": ["app"]
    },
    "database": {
      "image": "postgres:18",
      "network_groups": ["backend"],
      "aliases": ["database"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Producing a Resource

```json
{
  "volumes": ["database-data"],
  "services": {
    "database": {
      "image": "postgres:18",
      "aliases": ["database"],
      "environment": {
        "POSTGRES_DB": "app"
      },
      "volumes": [
        {
          "name": "database-data",
          "mount_path": "/var/lib/postgresql/data"
        }
      ],
      "resources": [
        {
          "resource_type": "postgres",
          "name": "primary-database",
          "metadata": {
            "database": "app",
            "host": "database"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Here the manager provides the stable resource declaration and the `database` alias. The runner creates the resource network, attaches the producer, and publishes the runner-generated Docker platform connection.

## Example: Consuming a Docker Resource

```json
{
  "services": {
    "app": {
      "image": "example/app:1.0.0",
      "environment": {
        "DATABASE_HOST": "database"
      },
      "connections": [
        {
          "type": "Platform",
          "data": {
            "network": "resource-owner-resource-network"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The network value must come from the resolved resource connection.

Do not construct it manually.

The `DATABASE_HOST` value is application configuration supplied by the consuming manager from the resource contract. The runner attaches the container to the resolved network, but it does not derive or inject that hostname.

## Example: Removing Obsolete State

```json
{
  "remove_services": ["old-worker", "old-proxy"],
  "remove_volumes": ["temporary-cache"]
}
```

## Example: Updating a Redirect

```json
{
  "redirect": {
    "redirect": "https://app.example.com"
  }
}
```

## Example: Clearing a Redirect

```json
{
  "redirect": {
    "redirect": null
  }
}
```

## Implementation Workflow for AI Agents

When asked to implement a manager using this runner, follow this sequence.

### 1. Inspect the Manager Project

Identify:

- Manager entry point
- Input models
- Configuration models
- Available RPC calls
- Current metadata generation code
- Existing tests
- Local `AGENTS.md` instructions
- Expected response or return type

Do not begin by creating a new architecture when an established manager pattern exists.

### 2. Determine Manager Intent

Document internally:

- Services the manager owns
- Runner steps required
- Persistent volumes required
- Resources produced
- Resources consumed
- Connections created
- Connections removed
- Redirect behavior
- Teardown behavior

Keep this aligned with the actual user request.

Do not add speculative services or infrastructure.

At this stage, decide **what** the deployment requires. Do not calculate Docker container, volume, or network names; those are runner implementation details.

### 3. Resolve External State

Use available RPC calls to retrieve:

- Required resources
- Resource connections
- Existing connections
- Existing manager state

Validate ownership and availability.

Return a clear error when required state cannot be resolved.

For every consumed resource, retain the authoritative connection type and payload needed by the service. Do not expect a top-level connection-creation request to become a resolved service connection automatically.

### 4. Build Shared Models

If the manager project imports the runner's shared models, construct `models.Metadata` and its nested models directly.

If those shared models are unavailable, define manager-side transport types that reproduce the documented JSON contract exactly. Keep these transport types at the manager-to-runner boundary so they cannot drift into a competing domain model.

Do not add fields merely because an underlying container platform supports them.

Convert manager-local configuration into runner models at a clear boundary.

### 5. Validate the Plan

Check service dependencies, volumes, resources, bindings, and removals before returning the plan.

Ensure every raw JSON payload is valid.

### 6. Return Through the Manager Framework

Return metadata or configuration using the manager framework’s expected response.

Do not write `/run/config.json` directly unless the manager framework explicitly assigns that responsibility to the manager.

### 7. Add Tests

Do not assume the runner's tests establish conventions for the manager project. Follow the manager repository's existing test conventions while testing the runner contract described here.

Test:

- Minimal setup
- Full setup
- Missing required input
- Invalid resource resolution
- Existing connection behavior
- Update removals
- Redirect set and clear
- Teardown behavior
- JSON serialization
- Omission versus explicit empty values for pointer-backed fields
- Rejection of requested features that the runner contract does not support

Use deterministic UUIDs and values in unit tests.

### 8. Update Documentation

Update the manager’s:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- Configuration examples
- Input documentation

Do not update the runner documentation for manager-specific behavior.

## Rules for AI Implementers

When implementing code that targets this runner:

- Use the shared runner models.
- Preserve JSON field names.
- Preserve nil semantics.
- Keep service keys stable.
- Keep resource names stable.
- Resolve platform connection data from actual connections.
- Do not construct external network names.
- Do not create Docker containers, volumes, or networks from manager planning code.
- Do not reproduce runner-owned Docker naming formulas in the manager.
- Provide application-level hostnames, credentials, and connection settings when the resource contract requires them; the runner does not synthesize them.
- Declare new volumes explicitly.
- Remove services and volumes explicitly.
- Treat volume removal as destructive.
- Use runner roles only for one-time work.
- Return errors instead of terminating.
- Do not log secrets.
- Do not invent unsupported runner behavior.
- Do not silently modify the runner.
- Do not move manager files or package responsibilities without explicitly calling out the structural change.
- Make the smallest coherent implementation that satisfies the manager’s requirements.

## Unsupported Assumptions

Do not assume the runner currently provides:

- Kubernetes support
- Service readiness checks
- Automatic removal of omitted services
- Automatic removal of omitted volumes
- Autoscaling
- Protocol-specific port bindings
- Static container IP assignment
- Service/name resource reference resolution
- Resource-only connection deletion
- Transactional rollback
- Secret management
- Automatic environment generation from connection metadata
- Automatic image pulling policy configuration
- Health checks
- CPU or memory limits
- Host-path mounts

These require explicit runner changes before manager code may depend on them.

## Completion Checklist

Before declaring the manager implementation complete, verify:

- The manager returns valid runner metadata.
- All service images are defined.
- Service keys are stable.
- Dependencies exist and are acyclic.
- Required volumes are declared.
- Mount paths are absolute.
- Produced resources have stable names and types.
- Consumed Docker platform connections use exact resolved network names.
- Every service that needs a Docker resource network contains the resolved `Platform` connection in its own `connections` array.
- Top-level connection plans are not being mistaken for service network attachments.
- Manager code does not create Docker objects or calculate runner-owned Docker names.
- Removal operations are explicit.
- Connection operations use UUID-based resource references.
- Redirect nil semantics are correct.
- Any service command is a non-empty explicit string array; empty arrays are invalid for Docker, and no shell splitting or entrypoint override is assumed.
- No unsupported runner feature is assumed.
- Errors are returned with useful context.
- Secrets are not logged.
- Tests cover setup, update, and failure paths.
- Documentation reflects the implementation.
- The project passes formatting, tests, vetting, and build checks.

## Core Principle

Generate an explicit, valid execution plan and let the runner own platform execution.

The manager should decide what needs to happen.

The runner should decide how that plan is applied to Docker.
